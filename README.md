# Swift Windows Switcher

Alfred workflow to switch between open windows in the system and Safari tabs.

## Features
- Switch between the open windows using Alfred
- Switch between the Safari tabs using Alfred
- Very quick comparing to the alternative implementations because of the native search implementation.

## Source code

You can start exploring the source code at [main.swift](EnumWindows/main.swift)

### `ScriptingBridge` in Swift

It turns out, that `ScriptingBridge` implementation is not fully compatible with Swift.

(Classes like `SafariApplication` are not imported, so we can't use them).

One of the possible solutions to this issue is demonstrated in [SafariApplication.swift](EnumWindows/SafariApplication.swift)
